# odin-linked-lists

This project is a simple implementation of a singly linked list in JavaScript.
It demonstrates core linked list operations such as appending, prepending, searching, and modifying nodes.

## Example: Managing Fruits in Alphabetical Order

An example of using the linked list is managing a list of fruits in alphabetical order.
Operations such as adding fruits, removing the last element, inserting a fruit at a specific index, and checking if a fruit exists in the list are all demonstrated.
